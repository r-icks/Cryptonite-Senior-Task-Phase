Level 4>5:
Human readable files are the files which have ASCII 
To search in files we use 
find . -type f -exec file {}
Which would display all regular files along with executable files 
grep is used to search for a pattern or content of a file
We execute 
find . -type f -exec file {} + | grep ASCII
This shows that -file07 is the only human readable file

Also file command tells us what is the contents of the file 
So we can do file ./* to find contents of all the files of the given directory

Level 5>6:
Everything inside inhere is a directory 
We can do file ./*/* to see contents of all files inside all director
find . Gives us list of all files 
For finding files with parameter of size we can do find -size 
We use c for size in bytes
find . -type f -size 1033c 
Only file that shows up is file2 in directory maybehere07
